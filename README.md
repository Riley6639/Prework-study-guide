# PREWORK-STUDY-GUIDE

## Description

My project is a study guide for the prework that I did before my coding bootcamp course. 

- My motivation for this project was to be prepared for my upcoming bootcamp experience. 
- I did this project to dip my feet in the waters of coding. I'm coming into this as a beginner, and I wanted to complete this project as a start. 
- I went from having zero knowledge about coding, to having a foundation to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaSCRIPT. 
- I learned how to set up an ssh key and connect it to my github account. As well as learned some things about git bash and how to use the CLI. I also learned how to set up a study guide website for my notes.

## Installation

To set up my developer environment I first installed the required software onto my local computer. Next I set up an SSH key and connected my local enviorment to GitHUB. I was then able to set up a repository on GitHU and download the necessary starter code. I set up my study guide using VS code. I followed the steps to coding HTML as a structure for my website. Next used CSS to style it. Then used javaSCRIPT coding to set up the functions to the console. 

## Usage

Once at the website right click anywhere on the screen. Select the inspect option from the list. A window should come up on the left, or bottom, side of the screen. Navigate to the console tab to see a list of topics and a suggestion for what to study first! 

I,ve linked this screenshot to show what it looks like.

I followed the instructions given to me by the bootcamp prework modules. I also used ChatGPT when I got stuck on GItBash. https://github.com/omarigg04 commented on my issues post on CSS and had some advice.
